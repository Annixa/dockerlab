# Dockerlab üê≥‚öó=‚ù§Ô∏è
An easier way to develop and test your docker stacks.

# Purpose
If you have two stacks with similar configurations, chances are the port mappings will be the same as well. You *could* configure each stack to map to different ports on your host, but that would take a code change. If you didn't change the ports, you'd have a port collision on your host.

Dockerlab allows you to use the same host (or cluster of hosts) to spin up mini docker-in-docker environments for:
- Testing multiple versions of the same software stack
- Giving users the ability to spin up their own stack that don't normally have to ability to spin up new servers
- Cultivating your own private environment for testing the compatbility of different software stacks.

# Components
Each of the components are in their own respository for flexibility of development and standalone usage:
- [WWW](https://github.com/Annixa/dockerlab-www), as the center piece for managing labs, users, and settings.
- [DNS](https://github.com/Annixa/dockerlab-dns), for handling subdomain requests to each lab.
- [LAB](https://github.com/Annixa/dockerlab-lab), the lab image used for each lab within the Dockerlab environment.
- [LDAP](https://github.com/Annixa/dockerlab-ldap), the LDAP container for managing users within the Dockerlab environment. 
- [VPN](https://github.com/Annixa/dockerlab-vpn), the VPN container used for access to the userspace (labs).
